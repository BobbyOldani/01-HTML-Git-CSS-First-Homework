My First Homework (Portfolio)

Description:

I created this portfolio for myself using basic html and css. I used three seperate html documents for each page and styled them all with
one style sheet. Everything is fairly straight forward. I created a header div and placed a nav bar and name div within it. I had to line
both of these up with the main content div. I also created a sticky footer on the bottom. My main content div changed thoughout the three html
documents. The most complicated being the portfolio page. I struggled with getting the picture divs to line up in a 3 row 2 column layout.
Naturally they wanted to align themselves in a 3 column 2 row layout and I was forced to create another set of divs called "boxrow" in order
to get box layout as intended.

Credits
My friend and developer Matthew Emma gave me the idea of using the boxrow div's to create my 3 rows for my portfolio page
Matthew Emma also helped me with the code to change the margin of my boundry within my header to keep my header content in
line with my main container div.
