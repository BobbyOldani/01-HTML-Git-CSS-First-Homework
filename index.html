            <p>Welcome to the mind of yours truly. I would like to issue a formal apology to anyone who may 
                or may not be forced to read this. It is not my intention to bore you. I am here to tell you
                a little bit about myself. I figure that the easiest way to do this is to tell you about What
                I might be doing if I weren't sitting down at my keyboard writing this very text.</p>

            <p>One senario may find me standing 5000ft above sea level, snow falling silently through the
                the crisp air of Stevens Pass. At this point the only thing I would hear would be my breath and the
                sound of my own thoughts. I would take one last deep breath before pointing my snowboard
                downhill. At this point, everything would go quiet. This is the feeling that I strive for, a
                nearly undescribable feeling. A feeling only acheivable by complete focus.</p>

            <p>Another senario may find me at a bar with friends and family. Eating my favorite comfort food
                while sipping on a new IPA. While I realize that this senario may not be nearly as healthy as
                the last, there are very few places I would rather be.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, maybe I'm right where I should be...</p>
